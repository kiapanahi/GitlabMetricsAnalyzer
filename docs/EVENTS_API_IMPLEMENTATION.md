# Implementation Update: Using GitLab Events API

## Problem

The initial implementation relied on fetching commits by filtering by user email address. This approach had a critical flaw: **users might not have their email addresses configured in GitLab**, causing the analysis to fail.

## Solution

Switched to using GitLab's **Events API** (`/users/:user_id/events`) which:
- Directly queries events associated with a user account
- Does NOT require email addresses
- Is more reliable and performant
- Uses official GitLab API endpoint designed for this purpose

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Models

**File: `GitLabApiModels.cs`**
- Added `GitLabEvent` - Represents a user event
- Added `GitLabPushData` - Contains push event details (commit count, timestamps)
- Added `GitLabEventProject` - Simplified project info in events
- Added `GitLabEventAuthor` - User who performed the action

**File: `DTOs/GitLabEvent.cs`**
- Added DTO records for deserializing GitLab Events API responses
- Follows existing DTO pattern with `JsonPropertyName` attributes

### 2. Updated GitLabHttpClient

**Interface Changes:**
- Added `GetUserEventsAsync(userId, after, before, cancellationToken)` method

**Implementation:**
- Fetches events from `/users/:user_id/events`
- Filters to only `action_name = "pushed"` events
- Supports date range filtering with `after` and `before` parameters
- Maps DTOs to domain models

### 3. Updated CommitTimeAnalysisService

**Core Logic Changes:**
```csharp
// OLD APPROACH (email-based)
var contributedProjects = await GetUserContributedProjectsAsync(userId);
foreach (var project in contributedProjects) {
    var commits = await GetCommitsByUserEmailAsync(project.Id, user.Email, since);
    // Process commits...
}

// NEW APPROACH (events-based)
var events = await GetUserEventsAsync(userId, after, before);
foreach (var event in events) {
    // Each event contains commit count and timestamp
    // No need to fetch individual commits
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Removed email dependency check
- Single API call instead of multiple repository queries
- Uses push event timestamps instead of individual commit timestamps
- Counts commits from `PushData.CommitCount` in each event

### 4. Updated MockGitLabHttpClient

Added mock implementation of `GetUserEventsAsync` that:
- Generates 20-50 random push events
- Distributes events across different hours
- Includes realistic commit counts (1-5 per push)
- Works with existing mock test data

## API Comparison

### GitLab Events API Response
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "action_name": "pushed",
  "created_at": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "project_id": 456,
  "push_data": {
    "commit_count": 3,
    "action": "pushed",
    "ref_type": "branch",
    "ref": "main",
    "commit_title": "Fix bug in user service"
  }
}
```

### What We Extract
- **Timestamp**: `created_at` - when the push happened
- **Commit Count**: `push_data.commit_count` - how many commits
- **Project**: `project_id` - which project
- **User**: Implicitly the user who triggered the event

## Benefits

### 1. Reliability
- ✅ Works even if users don't have email configured
- ✅ Direct association with user account
- ✅ Uses official, well-supported API

### 2. Performance
- ✅ Single API call vs N project queries
- ✅ Events API is optimized and indexed
- ✅ Faster response times

### 3. Accuracy
- ✅ Events are definitively tied to the user
- ✅ No ambiguity with email matching
- ✅ Captures all push activity

### 4. Simplicity
- ✅ Simpler code logic
- ✅ Fewer API calls
- ✅ Less error handling needed

## Testing

The mock implementation allows for testing without a real GitLab instance:
```csharp
// Set UseMockClient = true in configuration
// Mock will generate random push events for any user ID
var analysis = await service.AnalyzeCommitTimeDistributionAsync(userId: 1, lookbackDays: 30);
```

## Documentation Updates

Updated the following documentation:
1. **COMMIT_TIME_ANALYSIS_API.md** - Implementation details section
2. **TESTING_COMMIT_TIME_ANALYSIS.md** - Troubleshooting section
3. **COMMIT_TIME_ANALYSIS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md** - Technical details and key features

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None for API consumers (endpoint signature unchanged)
- Internal implementation change only

### Behavioral Changes
- Timestamps now based on push events (not individual commits)
- More accurate for batch commits (all commits in a push share same timestamp)
- May show slightly different distributions compared to commit-level timestamps

### Configuration
- No configuration changes required
- Works with existing GitLab API token permissions
