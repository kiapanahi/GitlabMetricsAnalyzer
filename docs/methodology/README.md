- **Transparent Calculations**: Every algorithm documented with step-by-step explanations
- **Audit-Ready**: Complete change log and version history maintained
- **Industry-Aligned**: Based on DORA metrics and Microsoft developer productivity research
- **Limitation-Aware**: Clear documentation of what metrics cannot measure

### Data Quality Assurance

- **Source**: GitLab CE/EE API (exact data)
- **Update Frequency**: On-demand calculation with current data
- **Quality Monitoring**: Automated data quality scoring
- **Version Control**: All methodology changes tracked and approved

## Metric Definitions

### 1. Productivity Score

**Definition**: Composite score measuring developer output and efficiency across multiple dimensions

**Calculation**:
```
1. Calculate commits per day: total_commits / period_days
2. Calculate MRs per week: total_merge_requests / (period_days / 7)
3. Get pipeline success rate: successful_pipelines / total_pipelines
4. Apply weighted formula: (commits_per_day × 2) + (mrs_per_week × 3) + (pipeline_success_rate × 5)
5. Normalize to 0-10 scale: min(10, max(0, score))
```

**Data Sources**:
- GitLab commit history (exact)
- GitLab merge request data (exact)
- GitLab pipeline results (exact)

**Limitations**:
- Does not account for commit/MR complexity or size
- May favor frequent small commits over thoughtful larger ones
- Pipeline success influenced by infrastructure issues outside developer control
- No consideration for code review quality or thoroughness
- Weekend and holiday work patterns not normalized

**Interpretation**:
- **0-2.9**: Below expectations - significant improvement needed
- **3.0-4.9**: Needs attention - some areas for improvement  
- **5.0-7.4**: Meeting expectations - solid performance
- **7.5-10.0**: Exceeding expectations - excellent performance

**Industry Context**: Based on research from Google's DORA metrics and Microsoft's developer productivity studies. Aligns with industry standards for measuring developer effectiveness.

**Version**: 2.1 | **Last Updated**: Current

### 2. Velocity Score

**Definition**: Measures development velocity based on the frequency of commits and merge requests

**Calculation**:
```
1. Calculate commits per day: total_commits / period_days
2. Calculate MRs per week: total_merge_requests / (period_days / 7)
3. Apply weighted formula: (commits_per_day × 2) + (mrs_per_week × 3)
4. Normalize to 0-10 scale: min(10, result)
```

**Data Sources**:
- GitLab commit history (exact)
- GitLab merge request data (exact)

**Limitations**:
- Pure velocity metric without quality considerations
- Favors quantity over impact
- Does not account for work complexity

**Interpretation**:
- **0-3**: Low velocity
- **4-6**: Moderate velocity
- **7-10**: High velocity

**Note**: High velocity should always be balanced with quality metrics.

**Version**: 1.0 | **Last Updated**: Current

### 3. Pipeline Success Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of successful CI/CD pipeline executions indicating code quality and testing effectiveness

**Calculation**:
```
1. Count total pipelines triggered by user
2. Count successful pipeline executions
3. Calculate rate: successful_pipelines / total_pipelines
4. Express as percentage: rate × 100
```

**Data Sources**:
- GitLab pipeline execution logs (exact)

**Limitations**:
- Infrastructure failures may impact score unfairly
- Flaky tests can skew results
- External dependency failures outside developer control
- Does not differentiate between different types of failures

**Interpretation**:
- **0-70%**: Poor - significant quality issues
- **70-85%**: Fair - some improvement needed
- **85-95%**: Good - solid quality practices
- **95-100%**: Excellent - exceptional quality

**Industry Benchmark**: DORA metrics suggest high-performing teams maintain >90% success rates

**Version**: 1.0 | **Last Updated**: Current

### 4. Collaboration Score

**Definition**: Composite score measuring developer participation in collaborative activities and knowledge sharing

**Calculation**:
```
Complex calculation involving:
1. Review participation: reviews_given + reviews_received
2. Knowledge sharing: unique_reviewers + unique_reviewees
3. Weighted scoring based on collaboration diversity and activity level
4. Normalization to 0-10 scale
```

**Data Sources**:
- GitLab merge request reviews (exact)
- GitLab issue comments (exact)
- Derived reviewer relationships (derived)

**Limitations**:
- Does not measure quality of collaboration, only quantity
- May not capture informal knowledge sharing
- Biased toward teams that use formal review processes
- Solo developers may score artificially low

**Interpretation**:
- **0-3**: Limited collaboration
- **4-6**: Moderate collaboration
- **7-10**: Strong collaborative behavior

**Context Notes**:
- Larger teams naturally provide more collaboration opportunities
- Senior developers may mentor more, junior developers may receive more reviews

**Version**: 1.5 | **Last Updated**: Current
