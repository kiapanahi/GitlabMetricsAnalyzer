### ðŸ“Š Metrics Fully Documented

1. **ProductivityScore (v2.1)**
   - **Formula**: `(commits_per_day Ã— 2) + (mrs_per_week Ã— 3) + (pipeline_success_rate Ã— 5)`
   - **Scale**: 0-10 normalized
   - **Industry Context**: Based on DORA metrics and Microsoft research
   - **Limitations**: 5 documented limitations with mitigation strategies

2. **VelocityScore (v1.0)**
   - **Formula**: `(commits_per_day Ã— 2) + (mrs_per_week Ã— 3)`
   - **Purpose**: Pure development velocity measurement
   - **Usage**: Should be balanced with quality metrics

3. **PipelineSuccessRate (v1.0)**
   - **Formula**: `successful_pipelines / total_pipelines Ã— 100`
   - **Benchmark**: >90% for high-performing teams
   - **Limitations**: Infrastructure dependencies documented

4. **CollaborationScore (v1.5)**
   - **Measures**: Knowledge sharing and review participation
   - **Context**: Accounts for team size variations
   - **Recent Fix**: Bias against solo contributors addressed

### ðŸŽª Executive Dashboard Integration

#### Ready-to-Use Features:
```javascript
// Footnote integration
<MetricCard 
  value={8.2} 
  title="Productivity Score"
  footnote="Calculated using weighted algorithm combining commit frequency, MR throughput, and pipeline success rate"
  methodologyLink="/api/methodology/productivityscore"
/>

// Executive summary
const summary = await fetch('/api/methodology/executive-summary');
```

#### Board Presentation Ready:
- Executive summary with key limitations
- Comprehensive metric definitions
- Industry benchmarking context
