# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical investigation and analysis documents from the project's evolution. These documents are preserved for reference but describe features, architectures, or configurations that are no longer part of the current system.

## Archived Documents

### INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Branch**: `phase-1/investigation`
- **Purpose**: Initial investigation that discovered the PostgreSQL database infrastructure was completely unused
- **Status**: Historical - database infrastructure has since been removed

### CONFIGURATION_REVIEW.md
- **Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Branch**: `phase-1/investigation`
- **Purpose**: Analysis of configuration classes to identify unused components
- **Status**: Complete - all identified unused configurations have been removed

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date system documentation, see the main `/docs` directory:
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` - Current architecture and features
- `API_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - API endpoint documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions
- `CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` - Configuration options

## Why Archive?

These documents were moved to the archive as part of PR #1 (Critical Documentation Cleanup) to:
1. Remove obsolete content from active documentation
2. Preserve historical context for future reference
3. Maintain clean and accurate documentation in the main docs folder
4. Keep a record of the architectural evolution and cleanup decisions
